# Tic Tac Toe

A browser based Tic Tac Toe game, following the assignment requirements on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe-javascript#assignment).

The main concept behind this assignment is the use of modules and factory functions to organize code. By keeping most of the variables and methods private, the global namespace remains clean, and you can selectively expose the methods and properties that need outside access.
